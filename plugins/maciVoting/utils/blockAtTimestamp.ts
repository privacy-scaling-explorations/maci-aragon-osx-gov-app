/*
 * Optimized binary search algorithm to find the closest block number to a given timestamp,
 * using the latest block as a starting point to minimize redundant RPC calls.
 *
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è However, this approach becomes less efficient when querying timestamps far in the past.
 * The binary search always starts from the latest block, so for very old timestamps, it may
 * need to scan through a large number of blocks, resulting in many slow RPC calls.
 *
 * üí° To improve performance in these cases, a cache or index of known block timestamps (e.g.,
 * weekly checkpoints or a simple block ‚Üí timestamp map) could be used as a smarter starting
 * point for the binary search. This would allow the algorithm to skip large ranges of blocks
 * and converge much faster on the correct result.
